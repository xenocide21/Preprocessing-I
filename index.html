        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p> I am a student at Lambda School studying Full-Stack Web Development. My goal is to begin a long term career in the tech field using my skills as a web developer and achieve success within my company. With the technology industry ever expanding, now is the best time to join and build a foundation for the rest of my life. In addition to Web Development, I have extensive history in Automotive service, Computer Technology, audio systems, as well as experience in Construction and Oil field Services.</p> <br>

          <p>I would one day like to start my own business, after I have learned even more in the Computer Science field of knowledge. Building, programming, and maintaining computer systems has always been a passion of mine, and will continue to be so well into the future.</p>

          <h1>Experience</h1>
          <ul>
            <li class="tooltip"><a href="#" onclick="return false;">10+ years studying computer technology.<span class="tooltiptext">I started collecting computers and expanding my knowledge and understanding them at the age of 12. Fascinated by the way they worked I spent years learning the terminology and what each component does, how they interact together and over the years have built dozens of computers for personal use. While employed for a company as a refurbish technician, I restored hundreds of computers to factory settings at pre-determined specs.</span></a></li>
            <li class="tooltip"><a href="#" onclick="return false;">10+ years doing major vehicle repairs.<span class="tooltiptext">I have spent the greater portion of the past 12 years learning how to fix and repair any kind of automotive repair, but mostly specialized in Imports with 4 to 6 cylinders and fuel injected. I can rebuild engines or transmissions, do brake service and repair, tune-ups and more. It started as a hobby just working on my own cars, until I decided to go freelance and do repairs for others. Eventually I did work in a shop doing transmission swaps, and smaller jobs like brakes and drivetrain service.</span></a></li>
            <li class="tooltip"><a href="#" onclick="return false;">4 years professional car audio installer.<span class="tooltiptext">When I got my first car, I spent hours researching car audio systems. From that moment on, I began culminating my knowledge of subwoofers, tweeters, and full range speakers. For a long time I only used prebuilt boxes and whatever hardware I could get from walmart, until the day I worked with a friend to build a custom box. After that point, I began doing freelance car audio installation with custom boxes and wiring kits, with the customers chosen hardware. I would do an entire clean install from the components, to the subwoofers and amps, and in-dash kits with aftermarket head units. I really enjoy the look on peoples face when they hear that bass line!</span></a></li>
            <li class="tooltip"><a href="#" onclick="return false;">3 years professional PC repair tech.<span class="tooltiptext">As mentioned above, I worked for a company that recycled and purchased retired and used electronics. As a "Reuse Technician" it was my job to determine if there was any value after restoring to factory operation with minimum specs. If the cantidates were viable, I would clean, install a fresh securely wiped hard drive, and install a licensed copy of Windows to the unit to prepare it for resale on our sales channels.</span></a></li>
